          <p>Still not 100% sure what this is yet, but it's basically a realtime message board. This is in the dreaded proof-of-concept stage and it's basically a less-shitty version of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/live/" target="_blank">reddit live</a>. Written on top of the <span class="tag">Firebase</span> platform.</p>

            Written with <span class="tag">Node</span>. I understand that Node is not the best choice for this.
